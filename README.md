# portfolio
## My first portfolio project

This project was one of the first off platform projects I completed through the Front End Engineer curriculum created by Codecademy

Its main criteria were to
1) Wireframe your page
2) Build and style with HTML and CSS
3) Have at least some interactive elements using Vanilla Javascript
4) Publish using GitHub Pages

I am considering this a current WIP and will be centering my focus on projects elsewhere to begin to build my actual portfolio
